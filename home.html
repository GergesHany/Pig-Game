      The Pig Game is a dice-based two-player game. Players take turns rolling a
      six-sided die, accumulating points<br />
      with each roll. They can choose to roll again to add to their score but
      risk losing it all if they roll a one. <br />
      Players can also choose to "hold," saving their accumulated points. The
      first to reach a set point goal or a <br />
      predetermined number of rounds wins, adding a mix of risk and strategy to
      the game. The set point equals 100
