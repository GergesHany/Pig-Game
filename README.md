# Pig-Game

The `Pig Game` is a dice-based two-player game. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points with each roll. They can choose to roll again to add to their score but risk losing it all if they roll a one. Players can also choose to "hold," saving their accumulated points. The first to reach a set point goal or a predetermined number of rounds wins, adding a mix of risk and strategy to the game.
